# STAT184-HW-Template
 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template

The goal of this repository is to introduce the post one year covid dataset and how the covid vaccine reduces the mortality rate of infection. I'm using the covid_dataset.csv dataset.

In this assignment, I went into detail analyzing the mortality rate by vaccine status, mortality rate by age group, and mortality rates by age group and vaccine status.

We concluded that it is important to look at data in different contexts, but overall that the mortality rate of people 50+ years is higher than those vaccinated, and increasingly so compared to the 50 and under age group.
